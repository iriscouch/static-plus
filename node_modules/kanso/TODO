update commands to use new auth utils
- uuids

check node-couchapp still works as expected
- reupholster_sample a good starting point
- make packages.merge available in kanso-utils and add to node-couchapp package
- this will mean including kanso-utils in kanso itself so the merge functions don't
  diverge


From: #339

Care to check the dependencies and see if any can be moved to devDependencies? I quickly grepped the code and these candidate packages did not turn up.

- dust
- uglify-js
- couchapp
- watch
- scrawl

Even better, could we completely remove any of these? (Perhaps they are in kanso-utils now?)
