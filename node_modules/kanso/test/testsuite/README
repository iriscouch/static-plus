Kanso Test Suite App
--------------------

This app contains tests for the CommonJS modules used in Kanso.
These modules need to run both in CouchDB and in the browser
(depending on the module and the capabilities of the client).

To run the tests, push the app to the CouchDB instance you'd like
to test against and visit the app's rewrite URL. From here you can
run each module individually or all tests together.

Tests are in the tests directory of this app, and are written using
nodeunit. To add a new test module simply create a new commonjs module
in the tests directory and export the test functions you'd like to be
run. This app will detect it's presence and add it to the list of
available test modules automatically the next time it is pushed.
